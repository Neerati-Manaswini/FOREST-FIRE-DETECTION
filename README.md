# 🌲 Forest Fire Detection 

This project aims to detect forest fires from image data using deep learning techniques. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into "fire" and "no fire" categories, supporting the development of automated systems for early fire detection.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

* Build an image classification model using TensorFlow/Keras.
* Preprocess and augment datasets for better performance.
* Train and validate the model using standard evaluation metrics.
* Visualize performance with accuracy/loss plots.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes labeled images of forest areas with and without visible fire. Data is typically split into training and validation sets.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow/Keras
* OpenCV / PIL for image processing
* Matplotlib for visualizations

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook:
   `WEEK_2_Assignment(Forest_Fire_Detection).ipynb`

## 📊 Results

The model demonstrates reliable performance in identifying fire in forest imagery, making it a useful tool for environmental monitoring applications.
